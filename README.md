# E-Menu

As a part of my dissertation during my final year at university, I created a system which allows restaurant owners to add, delete, modify items to an E-Menu. Also, allows them to create and start orders, which will then notify the customer with a progress bar displaying how long the preparation time for their order will take (asynchronously). I used Angular 6 for the front end development and Firebase/Cloud Firestore for the backend development, thus heavily incorporating the Angular fire library throughout the development of the system. The projectâ€™s lifecycle was agile driven thus, I specifically used the Feature Driven Development (FDD) methodology to complete this project in time.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
