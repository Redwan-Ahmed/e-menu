## E-Menu

## What is this project?
This Project is my dissertation during my final year at City University of London, I created a system which allows restaurant owners to add, delete, modify items to an E-Menu. Also, it allows them to create and start orders, which will then notify the customer with a progress bar displaying how long the preparation time for their order will take (asynchronously). I used Angular 6 for the front end development and Firebase/Cloud Firestore for the backend development, thus heavily incorporating the Angular fire library throughout the development of the system. The projectâ€™s lifecycle was agile driven thus, I specifically used the Feature Driven Development (FDD) methodology to complete this project in time.

## What technologies I Used?
1. Angular 6
2. Firebase
3. Cloud Firestore
4. Redux
